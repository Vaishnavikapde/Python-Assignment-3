# Python-Assignment-3
# Assignment 3: Functions & Modules in Python

This repository includes two Python scripts that demonstrate the use of **functions** and **Python modules** as part of **Module 4** of the Python course.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Description:
This script:
1. Defines a function named `factorial()` that takes a number as an argument.
2. Calculates the factorial using a **loop** (or **recursion**).
3. Returns the result.
4. Calls the function with a sample number (e.g., 5) and prints the result.

### Example Output:
Factorial of 5 is: 120

## ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
Description:
This script:

Takes a number as input from the user.

Uses Python's built-in math module to calculate:

Square root

Natural logarithm (log base e)

Sine (in radians)

Displays all results clearly.

### Example Output (for input 25):

Square root of 25: 5.0  
Natural logarithm of 25: 3.218875  
Sine of 25 (in radians): -0.13235175
